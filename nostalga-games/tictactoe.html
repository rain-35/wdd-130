            <p class="snake-rules">Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is a fun twist on the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Instead of just one grid, you
                play on
                a 3x3 grid of smaller Tic-Tac-Toe boards. On your turn, you place your symbol ("X" or "O") on one of the
                small boards, and that tells your opponent where they have to play next. For example, if you play in the
                top-left corner of a small board, your opponent must play in the top-left small board of the big grid.
                You
                win a small board by getting three symbols in a row, and the goal is to win three small boards in a row
                on
                the big grid. If a small board is already won or full, you can play on any open small board. Itâ€™s a mix
                of
                strategy and planning, so think ahead to outsmart your opponent!
                Note: if you play aginst the computer it is likely to be very bad at the game, but have fun any way!</p>
