        <p>Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is a fun twist on the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Instead of just one grid, you play on
            a 3x3 grid of smaller Tic-Tac-Toe boards. On your turn, you place your symbol ("X" or "O") on one of the
            small boards, and that tells your opponent where they have to play next. For example, if you play in the
            top-left corner of a small board, your opponent must play in the top-left small board of the big grid. You
            win a small board by getting three symbols in a row, and the goal is to win three small boards in a row on
            the big grid. If a small board is already won or full, you can play on any open small board. Itâ€™s a mix of
            strategy and planning, so think ahead to outsmart your opponent!</p>
