      Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is a fun twist on the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Instead of just one grid, you play on a
      3x3 grid of smaller Tic-Tac-Toe boards. On your turn, you place your symbol ("X" or "O") on one of the small
      boards, and that tells your opponent where they have to play next. For example, if you play in the top-left corner
      of a small board, your opponent must play in the top-left small board of the big grid. You win a small board by
      getting three symbols in a row, and the goal is to win three small boards in a row on the big grid. If a small
      board is already won or full, you can play on any open small board. It’s a mix of strategy and planning, so think
      ahead to outsmart your opponent!

      Colored paragraph example
    </h3>
    <p class="colored">
      In this classic snake game, your goal is to control a growing snake and collect food while avoiding collisions
      with your own tail. Use the arrow keys (or WASD keys) to guide the snake in different directions. Each time the
      snake eats a piece of food, it grows longer, and your score increases. The game becomes more challenging as the
      snake's length increases, requiring careful maneuvering to avoid trapping yourself. You can adjust the game
      speed—slow, medium, or fast—before starting to suit your play style. Aim for the highest score you can achieve!

      Content

    <h3>Home page</h3>
    <p>
      The home page will have the logo and navigation bar on the left side, with labeled buttons for each page, Home,
      Snake game, and Dots and boxes. To the right of the navigation, taking up the rest of the page will be 4 labeled
      boxes that will showcase each of the games. They will have a grow effect when you hover over them with a simple
      picture inside each box to show what you are looking at. Clicking on one of these will also take you to the
      specified game. The first two boxes will have thumbnails of the specified game, the second two may have will have
      thumbnails of a game with the words Coming soon overlaid and they will have no grow effect showing you can't click
      them yet.

    <h3>Snake Game</h3>
    <p>
      The first game is a snake game where you control a snake and try to grow it longer by eating food and not letting
      it run to itself. This game is played with the arrow keys or the wasd keys, you will be able to change the speed
      of the snake to challenge yourself. The two pictures by the instructions will be the snake images.

    <h3>tic tac toe</h3>
    <p>
      The second game is Tic Tac Toe, this game is played against a friend so it is 2 player only (unless i have time to
      build a program to play against). I may also try to make this an ultimate tic tac toe if I have time. Tic tac toe
      is played by taking turns placing an X or an O in a 3x3 grid, the first player to get 3 in a row wins. Tic Tac Toe
      is a solved game so it wouldn't be terribly difficult to make an unbeatable program. Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is a
      large 3x3 grid filled with smaller 3x3 grids, you win an x or an o in the large grid by winning one of the small
      games, the first player is allowed to play wherever they want, but after that each player must play in the area of
      the large grid corresponding to the last spot placed. If that small grid has already been completed the next
      player is allowed to play anywhere they want. If i were to make this and try to make a program to play against, I
      would likely only have it focus on whatever small grid you are playing on.
