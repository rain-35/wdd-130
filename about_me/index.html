            Hello This is my fith semester at BYU-I, I am a 
            business management major so I fit really well in this class.

            My parents converted when I was four, 
            so I have been a member pretty much my whole life.

        <p >
            I enjoy playing video games, online with frineds and in person.
            Recently I have played a lot of Counter-Strike 2. I also play around with BeamNG.Drive.
